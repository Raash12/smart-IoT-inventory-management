# Smart Inventory Management System (React, Node.js, Firebase)

## Overview

This project is a Smart Inventory Management System built using React with TypeScript for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and Firebase for database and authentication services. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing inventory efficiently, tracking stock levels in real-time, and generating reports.

## Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration using Firebase Authentication.
* **Real-Time Data:** Utilize Firebase Firestore for real-time inventory updates across all connected clients.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized interface for usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Inventory Tracking:** Add, update, and delete inventory items with details like name, quantity, price, category, etc.
* **Search & Filtering:** Easily search and filter inventory items.
* **Reporting:** Generate basic reports to analyze inventory levels and trends (e.g., low stock items).

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, CSS (Potentially UI libraries like Material UI, Tailwind CSS, etc.)
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** Firebase Firestore (NoSQL Real-time Database)
* **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication
* **State Management (Frontend):** (Optional - e.g., Context API, Redux, Zustand)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js:** Version 14 or higher (includes npm or yarn). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **Firebase Account:** A Google account to create and manage Firebase projects ([firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/)).
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/smart-inventory-system.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your-username/smart-inventory-system.git)
    cd smart-inventory-system
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username/smart-inventory-system.git` with your actual repository URL)*

2.  **Firebase Setup:**
    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Create a new Firebase project (or use an existing one).
    * Enable **Authentication:** Choose desired sign-in methods (e.g., Email/Password).
    * Enable **Firestore Database:** Create a Firestore database in your project. Set up security rules appropriately (start in test mode for development, but configure secure rules for production).
    * **Register your Web App:** In Project Settings > General, add a web app (`</>`). Note down the `firebaseConfig` object provided â€“ you'll need this for the frontend.
    * **Backend Service Account (Optional but Recommended for Admin tasks):** In Project Settings > Service accounts, generate a new private key (`.json` file) for your Node.js backend if it needs admin privileges to interact with Firebase services. **Do not commit this file to Git.**

3.  **Backend Configuration (`/server` directory):**
    * Navigate to the server directory: `cd server`
    * Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory.
    * Add necessary Firebase configuration details to the `.env` file. If using a service account key:
        ```dotenv
        # .env (in server directory)
        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json
        # Add any other backend-specific environment variables (e.g., PORT)
        PORT=5001
        ```
        *(Ensure `path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json` points to the downloaded key file. Add `.env` and the key file to your `.gitignore`!)*

4.  **Frontend Configuration (`/client` directory):**
    * Navigate to the client directory: `cd ../client` (assuming you are in `/server`) or `cd client` (if in the root).
    * Create a Firebase configuration file (e.g., `src/firebaseConfig.ts` or use environment variables).
    * Add the `firebaseConfig` object obtained during Firebase web app registration:
        ```typescript
        // src/firebaseConfig.ts (Example)
        import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
        import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
        import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

        const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
          projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
          messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
          appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
        };

        // Initialize Firebase
        const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
        const auth = getAuth(app);
        const db = getFirestore(app);

        export { auth, db };
        ```
        *(Replace placeholders with your actual Firebase config values. Consider using environment variables for sensitive keys: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=...`)*

5.  **Install Dependencies:**
    * Install backend dependencies:
        ```bash
        cd ../server
        npm install
        # or yarn install
        ```
    * Install frontend dependencies:
        ```bash
        cd ../client
        npm install
        # or yarn install
        ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd ../server
    npm start
    # or npm run dev (if you have a dev script with nodemon)
    ```
    *(The backend server will typically run on a port like 5001)*

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm start
    # or yarn start
    ```
    *(The React app will usually open automatically in your browser, often on `http://localhost:3000`)*

## Usage

* Navigate to the application URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
* Register a new account or log in if you already have one.
* Use the dashboard interface to view, add, edit, or delete inventory items.
* Explore reporting features if implemented.
